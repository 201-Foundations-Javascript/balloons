        My background is in the health and legal fields. I decided to learn software development for a number of
        reasons, such as financial freedom and personal growth. A large part of my decision to go into this field is to
        find a way to make an impact in the world at a larger scale than I could make individually. I would love to grow and cultivate my skills within a small start up, as I have experience with several start ups and enjoy the personal aspects that can be found in that type of environment.

        Hi! Before coming to Code Fellows, I was an instructional designer for a sales tax software company. I’ve got
        experience in technical writing, instructional design, QA, and accounting that actually helps me be a good
        developer. I’m learning to be a full stack JavaScript developer, with plans to do front-end development. But,
        who knows, those plans may change when I learn more about the back end. Hope you enjoy our game!

        My core skillsets are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Communications. My background in sales and customer service
        make me an ideal candidate for working directly with clients to understand their needs and wants. I’m extremely
        passionate about advocating for LGBTQ and other marginalized people, so I’m looking for an entry level position
        at a non-profit where I can use my skills to help people in need.
