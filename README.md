### Final Project for Code Fellows 201

The purpose of this game is to improve hand-eye coordination. 

The object of the game is to pop balloons of a specified color as they appear on the screen.  As the game progresses, the balloons increase in frequency and quantity.  Points are awarded for each balloon popped and a score will be calculated.  The total score will be displayed in a chart displaying previous players scores.
